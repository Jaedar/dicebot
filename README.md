# dicebot

This is an irc dicebot. Currently most of the configuration is hardcoded in MyBotMain.java.

It has various lovely features, but for now you will have to use the force (read the source) to figure them out. Sorry about that. 

Example commands:
,roll 1d10+3d15+20-13
,div

# How to build
Have maven and jdk installed and configured.
Run mvn package or other appropriate command.
